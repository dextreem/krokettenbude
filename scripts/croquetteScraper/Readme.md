# Croquette Scraper

This script scrapes all croquettes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette) and stores them with some additional but random data to a JSON file.

This is a tiny helper script that helps generating some real world test data for the Croqueteria project.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Run the script:

```bash
python croquette_scraper.py
```
